# Applet Factory Concept Demo

### Background

To create a Trigger and Action based application which allows the building of Applets to perform an Action based on the state of a Trigger.

Two use cases are defined below as examples of Trigger and Action pairings (Applets). We should be able to build an Applet from any Trigger and Action pairing.
 
1. When leaving work I want to send a text message to my SO to let them know I'll be home shortly.
2. Every Monday at 9pm I want to send an email to myself to remind me to put the bins out.
